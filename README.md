### installer.sh
Assuming you have already installed a minimal Debian 12 install.
The series of shell scripts are intended to facilitate installing popular window managers.

Within the installer.sh file, you can choose to install the following window managers:
* dwm
* qtile

**Uncomment the lines in the bash script to enable installation.**

#### With regard to other scripts:
* discord-install.sh - installs the newest discord quickly from the current binary files.
* lapce.sh - installs the alpah version of the Lapce text editor.  
* ly.sh - installs the ly console manager (careful if you already have lightdm installed)
* neovim.sh - neovim in the Debian packages is somewhat dated.  This installs the newest from github.

Only default config here
